== Overview
Ring is a library inspired by Python's WSGI and Ruby's Rack that 
enables modular and concise Clojure web applications. Ring abstracts the details 
of HTTP and defines a simple API by which web application components can 
cleanly interact with each other.

== Quick Setup
All jars needed to load any of the ring.* libs in this distribution are 
included in the jars/ directory, 

To see Ring in action, run:
  
  java -Djava.ext.dirs=jars clojure.main src/ring/examples/hello_world.clj

You can learn more about Ring's dependencies at the following sites:

clojure.jar, clojure-contrib.jar:
  http://clojure.org
jetty-6.1.14.jar, jetty-util-6.1.14.jar, servlet-api-2.5-6.1.14.jar:
  http://www.mortbay.org/jetty/
commons-io-1.4.jar:
  http://commons.apache.org/io/
clj-html.jar, clj-html-helpers.jar, clj-backtrace.jar:
  http://github.com/mmcgrana

You can find additional example Ring apps in the src/examples directory of this
distribution, including a "basic stack" example that shows a typical Ring 
setup with wrapping middleware.

== Spec
Please consult the SPEC file at the root of this distribution for a complete 
description of the Ring interface.

== Development
Ring is being actively developed; you can track its progress and contribute at:
