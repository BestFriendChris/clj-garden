== Overview
Ring is a web application library inspired by Python's WSGI and Ruby's Rack, 
designed to encourage modular and concise web applications.

== Quick Setup
The various ring.* libs in this distribution depend on different jars, but if 
you have all of the jars included in the deps/ directory then you will be able
to use any of the libs in this distribution.

Note that Jetty is currently required as it is the only server for which we 
have implemented a Ring handler. The Jetty jars are also in the jars/
directory.

Your exect boot process will depend on your environement, but a simple Clojure script to get a hello world Ring app might look like:

  (require 'ring.handlers.jetty)
  
  (defn app
    [env]
    {:status  200
     :headers {"Content-Type" "text/html"}
     :body    "Hello World from Ring"})

  (ring.handlers.jetty/run {:port 8080} app)


== Examples
You can find 2 example Ring apps in the src/examples directory of this
directory; a "hello world" example consisting of a single function and 
"basic stack" example showing a typical Ring setup with common middleware.

== Spec
Please consult the SPEC file at the root of this distribution for a complete 
description of the Ring interface.
