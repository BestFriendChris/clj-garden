h1. Ring

Ring is a library inspired by Python's WSGI and Ruby's Rack that 
enables modular and concise Clojure web applications. Ring abstracts the details 
of HTTP and defines a simple API by which web application components can 
cleanly interact.

h2. Quick Setup

All jars needed to load any of the @ring.*@ libs in this distribution are 
included in the jars/ directory. To see a live Ring app, run:

    java -Djava.ext.dirs=jars clojure.main src/ring/examples/hello_world.clj
    curl localhost:8080/

You can find additional example Ring apps in the @src/examples@ directory of this distribution, including a "basic stack" example that shows a typical Ring  setup with wrapping middleware.

h2. Spec

Please consult the @SPEC@ file at the root of this distribution for a complete 
description of the Ring interface.

h2. Available Libs

 * @ring.jetty@: Handler for the Jetty webserver.
 * @ring.file@: Middleware that serves static files out of a public directory.
 * @ring.file-info@: Middleware that augments response headers with info about File responses.
 * @ring.dump@: Endpoint that dumps the Ring requests as HTML responses for debugging.
 * @ring.show-exceptions@: Middleware that catches exceptions and displays readable stack traces for debugging.
 * @ring.reloading@: Middleware to automatically reload selected libs before each requests, minimizing server restarts.
 * @ring.builder@: Helpers for combining Ring endpoints and middleware into Ring apps.
 * @ring.lint@: Linter for the Ring interface, ensures compliance with the @SPEC@.
 * @ring.examples.*@: Various example Ring apps.

h2. Development

Ring is being actively developed; you can track its progress and contribute at: "github.com/mmcgrana/ring":http://github.com/mmcgrana/ring.

To run all of the @ring.*@ unit tests:
   
    java -Djava.ext.dirs=jars clojure.main test/ring/run.clj
