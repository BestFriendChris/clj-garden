Convert to hash based response, like with env?
Or perhaps optional 4 elem, a hash

(let [[status headers body] response]
  (do something))

(let [[_ headers _] response]
  )

(let [{status :status headers :headers body :body} response]
  (do something))

(let [{headers :headers} response]
  (do something))


(let [{:keys [status headers body]}]
  (do something))

(let [{:keys [headers]} response])


(let [{fred :fred ethel :ethel lucy :lucy} m] ...

can be written:

(let [{:keys [fred ethel lucy]} m]

Yeah probably going to want this, espc to beable to pass non-response values
down the response cascade in a funcitonal way - ruby does it with env mods

force, delay for the win - not completely transparent but simple, java
takes care of the caching
