- form-set
  - form-init, form-create, form-update-attrs
  - or just one path, but w/ double coercion

Later
- datetime caster
- migrations
- more validators
- key-based window pagination
- select-except
- multi-order (while still keeping simple case)
- associations
- aggregations
- calculations
- locking
- observers
- serialization
- identity map
- double check escaping
- multi-repository, sharding


Implementation
- handling of mutual model dependencies (dynamic resolution)


Tangential
- assoc assoc-in (update) update-in
