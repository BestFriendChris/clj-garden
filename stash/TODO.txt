Blocking
- attribute methods
- transactions
- form-set
- error messages
- form helpers
- test and doc clj-time


Want
- extensions
- migrations
- more validators
- key-based window pagination


Distant
- datetime caster
- select-except
- multi-order (while still keeping simple case)
- associations
- aggregations
- calculations
- locking
- observers
- serialization
- identity map
- awsome-backtrace
- double check escaping
- multi-repository, sharding


Implementation
- handling of mutual model dependencies (dynamic resolution)
- rethink passing model when only need data source
- datetime caster
- faster number casting
- include original query in exceptions raised within db calls
- defmodel might be made to infer the table name.


Tangential
- running unit tests without reboot for better speed
- cljack to search over clojure code
- assoc assoc-in (update) update-in
