h3. GitCred: PageRanking GitHub users

GitCred attempts to measure the 'cred' of GitHub users. It works by scraping followers data from GitHub pages and then applying the classic PageRank algorithm to the resulting users/followers graph.

You can find the results for a recent GitCred computation in RESULTS.txt. These values are logarithmically scaled and normalized so that they correspond to the familiar Google PageRank measure.

h3. For Clojure programmers

GitCred is implemented in Clojure, leveraging the Jung Java graph library to perform the actual PageRank computations and the following Clojure libraries to help with data gathering:

* clj-http-client: pulling down the GitHub pages
* clj-scrape: extracting the needed data from these pages
* stash, clj-jdbc: ORM and supporting JDBC abstraction for persisting the data

These Clojure libraries are not released yet, but the code is available for you perusal in the clj-garden incubator project in which GitCred is also located.
