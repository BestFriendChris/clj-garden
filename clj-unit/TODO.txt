show exception class?

perhaps symbol instead of string names to allow choice

running unit tests without reboot for better speed

per-assertion file and line numbers

nested tests

per-function tests, attached to function

perhaps allow some sort of error message input to assertions so that you know what went wrong, as in ruby's test/unit

Perhaps use assert-truth for current assert-that, then expose assert-that as
user-facing assertion.
