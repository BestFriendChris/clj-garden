  ; return value based or not???
  ; perhaps if can return an assertion or a seq-able of assertions

  ; possibilities
  ; * compile-time error
  ; * exception before assertion
  ; * exception in inner assertion forms
  ; * returns non-assertion
  ; * returns a failing assertion
  ; * returns a passing assertion

  ; do we defintely need non-return value based assertions, can we get away with
  ; not having those??
  ; transaction testing
  ; convience w/ many asserts
  ; story-type tests
  ; would really like a way around this.
  ; 2 big cases: lots of assertions, and dealing with stateful systems (webapps)

  ;   (in-trans
  ;     (make-change)
  ;     (assert-changed)
  ;     (rollback))

  ; note current problem with failing - it doesn't stop after 2 examples if 2
  ; of 3 fails. note that escaped exception works as desired.
