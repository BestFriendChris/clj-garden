Check out templating, especially for tests
simplest dependency manager that could possibly work:
  no runtime component
  no searching for config files
  central data source
  each jar lists the jars on which it directly depends
  then apply search to get all needed jars
  could even write the file as a clojure data structure
  some libs will only conditionally depend on jars - just make a call 1 way

cling -> wiki w/ ring, weld, jgit "a Clojure Wiki Thing"

== ring
Linter
Try compiling carefully

== weld
Set up upload test helper so that it emulates the GC situation

framework
  tease apart with-filters
  seperate app-specific from general code in scripts/
  better cli for scripts

see if the weld-level routing logic can be simplified
