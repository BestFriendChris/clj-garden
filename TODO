check out james' comment on round-trip testing

simplest dependency manager that could possibly work:
  no runtime component
  no searching for config files
  central data source
  each jar lists the jars on which it directly depends
  then apply search to get all needed jars
  could even write the file as a clojure data structure
  some libs will only conditionally depend on jars - just make a call 1 way
