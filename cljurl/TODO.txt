logging: development
  - see sql queries and their times
    (dedicated, optional sql logging)
  - see how actions are routed
    (test outside of request/response cycle)
  - see response time breakdowns
    (dedicated, optional request timing and profiling middleware)
  
logging: testing
  - probably not useful (level :error)

logging: production
  - see sql queries and their times
    (buffered flat file dedicated to query times and queries)
    (postgres features)
  - see what requests are leading to 404s
    (dedicated file for 404 request info)
  - grep for long actions, common acitons
    ()
  - see exceptions
    (perhaps good for logging here)
  
perhaps select-with-logging, modify-with-logging
